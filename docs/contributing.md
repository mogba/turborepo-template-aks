# Contributing to this project

This project was built with PNPM workspaces technology to enable multi-packages within a single repository without creating tight coupling between packages.

Packages and apps (which are also packages) are published to NPM registry as individual private repositories and referenced from other workspace's packages as if they were installed by the package manager.

## Project structure

To know more about the project structure, refer to [Structuring a repository](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/structuring-a-repository) page.

### Internal packages

To know more about creating internal packages, which are packages with code shared by multiple apps, refere to Turbo [Creating an internal package](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/creating-an-internal-package) page.

### Package naming scheme

Projects inside this workspace should be named with the project name prefix: `@project-name/package-name`. You can also add the organization name. The package name is set in the `package.json`'s `name` property.

```json
{
  "name": "@project-name/package-name",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "type": "module",
  "private": true,
  "exports": {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

## Turborepo tasks

### Depending on tasks in dependencies with ^

The ^ microsyntax tells Turborepo to run the task starting at the bottom of the dependency graph. If your application depends on a library named ui and the library has a build task, the build script in ui will run first. Once it has successfully completed, the build task in your application will run.

For more information, go to [Configuring tasks](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/configuring-tasks) page.

### Running tasks or packages independently

To run tasks or packages independently, like for when you need to work on just 3 out of 10 packages, there are some different ways to achieve that. Go to [Running tasks - Using filters](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/running-tasks#using-filters) page.

## Environment variables

### Adding environment variables to task hashes

Turborepo needs to be aware of your environment variables to account for changes in application behavior. To do this, use the env and globalEnv keys in your turbo.json file.

```json
{
  "globalEnv": ["IMPORTANT_GLOBAL_VARIABLE"],
  "tasks": {
    "build": {
      "env": ["MY_API_URL", "MY_API_KEY"]
    }
  }
}
```

Despite that, Turborepo automatically adds environment variables for common frameworks, such as Next.js. This means you don't need to manually configure tasks' `env` key with environment variables starting with `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` prefix. This behavior is enable through a feature called framework inference, which may be disabled, if needed.

For more information, visit [Using environment variables](https://turbo.build/repo/docs/crafting-your-repository/using-environment-variables) page.

#### Extraordinary environment variables

Any variable that don't match the prefix `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` and should be accounted on tasks hashes, should be manually included on `turbo.json` file.
